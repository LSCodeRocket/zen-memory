# Desired Features

## Simple Modding/Plugin Making Procedure
Making each new addition to Zen Memory have some easy way to add each game (a template format and documentation).


## Database and Application Version Control
The application downloaded on computers will host all the data that was collected from their activities. When they visit the website, they can still do all the things they can do on the application but the analytics will be gone. The problem is that the data cannot be kept on the website system. Perhaps the database can be used here to sync changes between the application and the website, but it is unlikely. The application-based solution is the best.

## Memory Training

Specific challenges to train memory like in Memory League.

### All Basic Memory League Games
Card Memorization, Number Memorization, and Word Memorization as well as ways to change the way that it is presented. 3 cards at once, 2 cards and 2 cards and such. However, "Names", "Images" and "International Names" may be a bit difficult because we do not have access to the databases containing these. However, there will probably be image datasets for AI and machine learning training, so we might be able to find some for free. Additionally, a purely sequential feature will be added (such that you cannot go back).

### Memorizing Colors, Tables of Numbers, Licence Plates
Regular Memorization, just like with cards, but for colors, tables of numbers and license plates.

### Voiced Numbers, Words, Colors and Cards
Adding a format to numbers, words and cards to add a voiced mode. It might be difficult to generate voices on command for words, so it might not be possible without either intensive computational resources or a lot of money.

### Specific Question Training
"What was the 56th digit?" "What is the sum of the 35th digit and the 94th digit?" "Is the 8th card black or red?" 



### Chimp Test
You can determine the starting grid size and how many appear, and whether or not the chimp test will continue in progressive difficulty or just stay at the current one.

### Memorizing Digits of PI, E, and TAU
This is to help people training for competitions or just as a challenge. It will look at lot like Number Memorization for memorization and then there are digit tests where you literally just type the numbers.

### Memorizing the Periodic Table
Boiling Point, Melting Point, etc. All of the necessary features to clearly describe all atoms on the periodic table.

### Password Memorization
Alphanumeric character memorization as well as general symbol memorization like "n239fb&#FHNBFOFB)#$U". Incredibly difficult to learn, easy to program.

### Card and Number Timer


## Memory Games 

Games to have fun with memory while training.

### Matching for Words, Cards and Numbers
You would be able to choose the number of pairs and the specific cards and numbers that are able to be sampled from. You would be able to select the grid size and the card size so that screens can view it. This may be really difficult on small mobile devices.

### Go Fish
Very simple game. You would be able to choose how many players there are and the difficulty of the players (probably from beginner to perfect).


## Analytics

### Most Missed Cards and Numbers
Collect the most recent most missed cards and numbers and be able to manipulate the queue size in the application so that more data can be collected if desired.

### Rudimentary Elo Calculation
Even though this may lead to cyber-security issues of people inflating their elo after cracking the encryption scheme to store the game and training data, I think that people would appreciate an elo going up. Additionally, these may not be shown to other players.


## Optional Features

### PAO Memorization Tool
A tool that would help people review their own PAO systems for types of data. This is in the optional features because people use anki and it's pretty good at what it does already. It might be beneficial because all the tools will be in one place.

### Electron/Tauri Nodejs Application
This would make it possible for people to use the software without using a web browser, and they could save their own file data. It would make a lot of sense if the database architecture costs a lot of money.

### Other Languages
Hopefully other languages can be added other than English, but for the moment, it is just English.

### TicTacToe but Blindfolded and Different Sizes of Boards 
A very difficult game that might not even be possible with memory techniques.

### Reward System for Points?
Unlocking new themes perhaps? Unlocking Memory Palaces to explore?

### Memory Palace Exploration
Three.js Memory Palace tours? Though the graphics might be very intensive.
